# AMT_Gamification
# Context
This repo contains the code to run a gamification API. It is a project proposed by [Olivier Liechti](https://github.com/wasadigi) in the context of our [AMT lesson](https://github.com/SoftEng-HEIGVD/Teaching-HEIGVD-AMT-Lectures) at HEIG-VD.

## Setup
Before getting started you'll need [JDK 1.8+](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html), [Gradle 2.3+](https://gradle.org/gradle-download/) and [Maven 3.0+](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

## Run
Then, after cloning this repo, open `build.gradle` in your favorite IDE (we use [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)), build and run the app. This may take a while since there are dependencies to download...

## Use
Once the app is running, you can check out the first "Hello World" by going to `localhost:8080` on your web browser.

## Tests
All the testing are in the `tests/` folder: [here](https://github.com/moodah/AMT_Gamification/tree/master/tests)
