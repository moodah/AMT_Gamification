# AMT_Gamification

## Setup
Before getting started you'll need [JDK 1.8+](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html), [Gradle 2.3+](https://gradle.org/gradle-download/) and [Maven 3.0+](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

## Run
Then, after cloning this repo, open `build.gradle` in your favorite IDE (we use [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)), build and run the app. This may take a while since there are dependencies to download...

## Use
Once the app is running, you can check out the first "Hello World" by going to `localhost:8080` on your web browser.
